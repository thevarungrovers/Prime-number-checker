# Prime number checker

#Challenge
The challenge was to create a program that takes input from the user and checks whether a number is prime or not.

#How it works
- It first takes input from the user to enter a positive number.
- Then, it checks whether it is positive or not.
- After this, it throws an error if the number is not positive or zero.
- If the number is positive, then it is divided by numbers 1 less than the input.
- While dividing with numbers, if the remainder becomes 0, it proves that the number which is taken by the user is not a prime or vice-versa.
